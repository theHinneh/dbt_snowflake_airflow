# Data Pipeline Project

Welcome to my new dbt (data build tool) project! This project is designed to help manage and transform data using dbt.

## Project Structure

Here is an overview of the project structure:

- **analyses/**: Directory for storing analysis queries.
- **dbt_packages/**: Contains dbt packages, including `dbt_utils` which provides useful macros.
- **dbt_project.yml**: The main configuration file for the dbt project.
- **logs/**: Directory for storing log files.
- **macros/**: Directory for storing custom macros.
- **models/**: Directory for storing dbt models, organized into marts and staging.
- **seeds/**: Directory for storing seed files.
- **snapshots/**: Directory for storing snapshot files.
- **target/**: Directory for storing compiled SQL files and other artifacts.
- **tests/**: Directory for storing test files.

### Using the Starter Project

To get started with this project, try running the following commands:

- `dbt run`: This command will compile and run the dbt models, transforming raw data into the desired output.
- `dbt test`: This command will run tests on the data to ensure its quality and integrity.

### Resources

Here are some resources to help you learn more about dbt and get support:

## Additional Information

This project includes several important files and directories:

- **dbt_project.yml**: This file contains the configuration settings for the dbt project, such as the project name, version, and profile.
- **macros/**: This directory contains custom macros that can be used in dbt models.
- **models/**: This directory contains dbt models, which are SQL files that define how raw data should be transformed.
- **seeds/**: This directory contains seed files, which are CSV files that can be loaded into the database as tables.
- **snapshots/**: This directory contains snapshot files, which are used to capture the state of data at a specific point in time.
- **target/**: This directory contains compiled SQL files and other artifacts generated by dbt.

I hope this README helps you understand the structure and purpose of this dbt project. Happy data modeling!
